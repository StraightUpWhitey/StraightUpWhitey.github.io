<h1>History Of The <a href="http://www.spsd.sk.ca/school/waltermurray/Pages/default.aspx">Marauders!</a> </h1>
<p>Walter Murray Collegiate Institute or WMCI was established in 1962 and is part of the Nutana Saburban Development Area.
   Walter Murray was named after Walter Charles Murray, the first president of the UofS. Walter Murray is one of 2 highschools to allow you to take the advanced program.
   We also allow people to participate in our <strong>Full French Immersion Program</strong>.WMCI has a very good sporting community, we have a very good cross country team that won us 7 years in a row the city champion title and we also have added a new Hockey Program. Recently in the fall of 2014 our boys won us a soccer title beating Holy Cross in the City Championship.
   Walter Murray overall is a great school and has a very good work ethic and pleasant environment, if you had any questions and concerns come in and ask us personally for the best help!(Wikipedia,Walter Murray Collegiate Institute)</p>
